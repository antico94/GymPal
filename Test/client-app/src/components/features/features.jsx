                                    because regular reminder boosts your motivation levels. A fitness tracker lets you

                                    <li>To achieve the best results, you will have to set a realistic goal that can be
                                        achieved. You cannot shed weight if you lead a sedentary life and do not
                                        exercise. However, if you use a fitness tracker, it will help you set and
                                        achieve realistic goals within the recommended time frame. It also makes sure

                                    <li> Because effort is more directly under our control, we can achieve more by
                                        exercising self-discipline and putting in more effort. Grit, a form of
                                        self-discipline combined with high passion for something, is a particularly
                                        desirable trait that correlates with success in various educational settings.

                                    <li>Many other factors are important in accomplishment. Believing in our ability
                                        increases performance and likelihood of success. In fact, having others who
                                        believe in us also improves our performance, as do social relationships. The
                                        belief that we can change through effort is called a growth mindset, compared to
                                        a fixed mindset. IQ accounts for only about 20% of success.

                                    <li>To give ourselves the best chance of success, we need to make our goals even
